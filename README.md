# Movie Recommender System ML Project

A machine learning powered movie recommendation system — built using Python — that lets users input a movie and get suggestions for other similar films. It includes model training components, a web app interface, and necessary assets to deploy and serve recommendations.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (Flask, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.)
* Enough RAM & disk to load movie data and model artifacts

---

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mangal-singh001/Movie-Recommender-System-ML-Project.git
   cd Movie-Recommender-System-ML-Project
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Extract data:
   Unzip `Data.zip` into a folder if needed (so that training / model notebooks can access raw data).

## How to Use

* **To explore / retrain model**:
  Open `Movie-Recommendor-system.ipynb`. It contains data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, similarity computations, and evaluation.

* **To run the web app locally**:

  ```sh
  python app.py
  ```

  Then navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or port printed in console) to access UI.

* **To get recommendations programmatically**:
  Use `movies.pkl` and `movie_dict.pkl` to lookup movie metadata & compute nearest neighbors or similarity.

---

## Model & Data

* Data: Movie metadata (titles, genres, etc.), user ratings (if used), feature vectors.
* Model / Technique: \[content-based / collaborative filtering / hybrid] (describe the approach here)
* Serialized artifacts:

  * `movies.pkl` — precomputed movie feature vectors / embeddings
  * `movie_dict.pkl` — mapping from movie titles / IDs to metadata used by app

---

## Deployment

* `Procfile` and `runtime.txt` suggest readiness for deployment to platforms like Heroku.
* Use `setup.sh` for any initial setup required on the server.
* If exposing local server for remote testing / demos, `ngrok_connect.py` may be useful.

## Screenshots / Demos

*Insert here a few example screenshots showing the UI, recommendation output, etc.*

For example:

## Future Work

Here are some potential enhancements:

* More advanced model (matrix factorization, neural embedding, deep learning)
* Use user rating data to incorporate collaborative filtering
* Improve UI / add search, autocomplete movie titles
* Scale for larger datasets, more movies
* Deploy with containerization (Docker)
